The idea came from my dad who's working as private Quran therapist, so I decided to make this software to help him and
for other Quran therapists, whom don't want to share patients' data for any other "third party".
This Project is made for private doctors, therapists...
In this project I will make a GUI for saving patients data for future use, name, id, why he came, why he didn't came,
illnesses....
this project for private therapists and doctors to use for less price than the official software that almost all the
doctors and hospitals use, again it is made for private work, you cannot share patients data to another hospital or
doctors or therapist, until now...
