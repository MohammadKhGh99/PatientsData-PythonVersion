The idea came from my dad who is working as private therapist, so I decided to make this software to help him in saving his patients data safely.
This Project is made for private doctors, therapists...
In this project I will make a GUI to help user to understand what he can do with this software.
you can save fullname, id number, phone number...
I used sqlite3 for handling the data, inserting, updating and searching.
* You can make an xlsx file from the data you have of all the patients.
* You can save your work to google drive, if you click the "save to google drive" button (in ArabicðŸ˜…) a browser will open to enter your google account,
  then a copy of the xlsx file and the main database will be exported to google drive in a folder.
* You can restore your work from google drive.
                                                                 
                                                                 
                                                                 
                                                                 Main Menu Page
